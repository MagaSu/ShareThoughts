# ShareThoughts app


I made this web application for practice, using VueJS and connecting to firebase servers.
I did everything myself (with some help from stackoverflow of course) from scratch, maybe you will find it useful.

The time of server on Firebase is over, a little bit later i will set it to new server.

What can you do in this application?

1. Create new account or log in
3. Tell about your thoughts.
4. Find another users.
5. Read the thoughts they shared.
6. Log out.
